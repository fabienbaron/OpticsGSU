# High Angular Resolution Imaging ASTR8800

## Installation

Only proceed with this installation once you've got all the prerequisites installed.
From Julia's command line, press ```]``` to access the package manager.
Add the package for this course: ```add https://github.com/fabienbaron/OpticsGSU```
Exit the package manager, and do: ```using OpticsGSU```.

## Updates
This is a reminder that you can use the Julia's package manager to update this package: ```update OpticsGSU```.

## Prerequisites

## Julia setup

Install the latest Julia from https://julialang.org/downloads/

Install the Atom editor https://atom.io/.

Install the language-julia Atom package from within the Settings/Preferences of Atom, Install tab: this enables syntax highlighting of Julia code.

Install the latex-completions Atom package from within Atom: this enables the autocompletion of LaTeX symbols (α, β, ...)

## Julia OSX first steps
Installing the PyPlot julia plotting library on OSX can be a bit tricky.
All the details are here if you need: https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl but here is a summary:

Mac users will need to have XQuartz installed first.
Then there are three possible paths:

Path 1: you've already got your own python installation and want to use it for this course, go to julia and type ```ENV["PYTHON"]="/pathto/python"``` where ```pathto``` is your actual path (check with ```which python``` from terminal).


Path 2: you don't have a python installation  and just want the default Julia on, go to Julia and type ```ENV["PYTHON"]=""```

Path 3: you want to install your own python from scratch, using HomeBrew https://brew.sh/. This is the most complicated way, and slow, but a surer way to have it work.
```
brew install python gcc freetype pyqt
brew link --force freetype
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python2.7:$PYTHONPATH"
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```
Then edit your ~/.profile to add the two export lines.
Create a file called ```~/.config/matplotlibrc``` with one line ```backend: Qt5Agg```.
Then go to Julia and type ```ENV["PYTHON"]="/usr/local/bin/python"```.

After any of these paths, go to the package manager ```]``` and type ```add PyCall```, then ```add PyPlot```.

## Check that you can use the REPL

1. Launch julia from the command line.

2. Check that it can do basic operations, e.g. input ```2+2``` then press enter.

3. Check that it can plot basic functions using the PyPlot library.

```julia
using PyPlot
x=range(-pi, pi, length=100)
plot(x,sin.(x))
grid()
```
